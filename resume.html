      <h3>Selected Projects</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>ML Explainability Framework</strong> <span class="muted">— Oct 2022</span><br>
        Tested the conceptual soundness of an ML model explainability framework developed for Fair Lending reporting using a Mortgage Default
        model built with <em>XGB</em>. Examined SHAP, ALE, ICE/PDP, Total Gain, Average Gain metrics, and Friedman H-Statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mortgage Default Modeling</strong> <span class="muted">— Aug 2022</span><br>
        Downloaded and sampled 15 million rows of Freddie Mac mortgage performance data using AWS S3, AWS Athena, and SQL. Developed an
        XGB model to predict mortgage defaults with class-imbalance considerations; final model achieved an F1 Score of <strong>70%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong> <span class="muted">— Jul 2022</span><br>
        Designed and implemented a system investigating how social media can instill anti-American sentiment among U.S. allies through
        misinformation and disinformation. Covered data collection, data handling, machine learning, and insight generation.
