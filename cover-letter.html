        <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>

        <p>
          I am writing to express my interest in an entry-level <strong>Data Scientist</strong> or
          <strong>Data Analyst</strong> position. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in <em>Data Analytics</em>
          (expected May 2026) and have hands-on experience in data analysis, predictive modeling, and
          building solutions that support both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my internship as a <strong>Data Scientist Intern</strong>, I strengthened my skills in
          <em>Python, SQL, AWS, machine learning, and model deployment</em>. I worked on projects including
          mortgage default modeling and ML explainability, focusing on turning complex data into clear,
          actionable insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role as an <strong>Operations Specialist</strong>, I manage financial tracking,
          client invoicing, and operational workflows—experience that has sharpened my attention to detail,
          data accuracy, and reliability in fast-paced environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also volunteer as a <strong>Youth Mentor</strong>, supporting students academically and helping
          them build confidence and strong learning habits. This work reflects my long-term interest in
          using data to improve educational outcomes and create meaningful impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am especially interested in organizations that value
          <mark>data-driven decision making</mark> and continuous learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team by applying strong analytical thinking,
          a consistent learning mindset, and clear communication. Thank you for your time and consideration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br>
          <strong>Dilara Cetinkaya</strong>
